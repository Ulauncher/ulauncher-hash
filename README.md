## History, Acknowledgements & Credits
This extension originally used to live at [ulauncher-hash2](https://github.com/friday/ulauncher-hash2) (which now redirects here). It was named ulauncher-hash2 because there was an earlier hash extension, created by [brpaz](https://github.com/brpaz), which was an inspiration for ulauncher-hash2. Since then brpaz unpublished his extension, archived the repository and redirected people to ulauncher-hash2.

Years after this friday became a Ulauncher maintainer and moved the extension to the Ulauncher organization. In this process the extension was also renamed, dropping the "2", since there's no other "ulauncher-hash" now.
