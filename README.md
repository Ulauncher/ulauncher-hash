[Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/) extension to generate hashes with md5, sha1 and sha2 (sha224, sha256, sha384 and sha512).

## Usage

## Alternatives
* [ulauncher-hash-lambda](https://github.com/xtrcode/ulauncher-hash-lambda) - Fork which supports more algorithms (may not be optimal for everyone - see [#1](https://github.com/friday/ulauncher-hash2/issues/1))
* [ulauncher-hash](https://github.com/brpaz/ulauncher-hash) - The first hash extension. Only supports the "hash" keyword, and not sha384. Now deprecated in favour of this one, but the extension still works.
