# ulauncher-hash2
[Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/) extension to generate hashes with md5, sha1 and sha2 (sha224, sha256, sha384 and sha512).

## Usage
* Install in Ulauncher using this url (https://github.com/friday/ulauncher-hash2)
* type `hash ` to show all supported hashes, or a specific algorithm like `md5` or `sha256` followed by a space and the string you want to hash. Ex `hash 123`, `md5 hello` or `sha256 foo bar` (any following space will be interpreted as part of the string).
